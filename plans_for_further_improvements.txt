1. **Logging Timestamps:**
   - Enhance logging by adding timestamps to log messages. This is relatively easy and provides better insight into the timing of events.

2. **Output Table Enhancement:**
   - Improve the output format by presenting information in a tabular format using a library like `prettytable`. This enhances readability without significantly increasing complexity.

3. **Detailed Error Messages:**
   - Provide more specific and informative error messages. While not difficult, it requires careful consideration of potential errors and appropriate messages.

4. **Interactive Timeout Adjustment:**
   - Implement an interactive mode allowing users to adjust the timeout during the scan. This involves user input handling but is manageable.

5. **Improved IP Address Validation:**
   - Extend IP address validation to not only check for valid IPv4 addresses but also attempt to resolve the IP address. Requires handling DNS resolution errors.

6. **Port Range Validation:**
   - Validate that port ranges provided by the user are within the valid range (1-65535). This involves checking user input and ensuring it meets specific criteria.

7. **Logging Enhancements:**
   - Extend logging to include more details about the scan, such as start time, end time, and total duration. This is more involved but adds valuable information for analysis.

8. **Banner Retrieval Enhancement:**
   - Modify the script to retrieve larger banners or additional information for a more comprehensive view. This may involve handling larger data volumes and is more complex.

9. **Support for UDP Scanning:**
   - Add the ability to perform UDP port scanning in addition to TCP scanning. UDP scanning introduces additional complexities due to the connectionless nature of UDP.

10. **Concurrency Level Adjustment:**
    - Allow users to specify the level of concurrency (number of threads) using a command-line argument. While it adds configurability, it requires careful management of thread safety.
