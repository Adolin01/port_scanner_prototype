1. **Logging Timestamps:**
   - Enhance logging by adding timestamps to log messages, providing better insight into the timing of events.

2. **Port Range Validation:**
   - Validate that port ranges the user provides are within the valid range of ports (1-65535). It will involve checking user input and ensuring it meets specific criteria.

3. **Output Table Enhancement:**
   - Improve the output format by presenting information in a tabular format using a library like `prettytable`.

4. **Detailed Error Messages:**
   - Provide more informative error messages. 

5. **Interactive Timeout Adjustment:**
   - Implement an interactive mode allowing users to adjust the timeout during the scan. It's tricky as this involves user input handling.

6. **Improved IP Address Validation:**
   - Extend IP address validation to check for valid IPv4 addresses and attempt to resolve the IP address. Requires handling DNS resolution errors.

7. **Port Range Validation:**
   - Validate that port ranges the user provides are within the valid range of ports (1-65535). It will involve checking user input and ensuring it meets specific criteria.

8. **Logging Enhancements:**
   - Extend logging to include more details about the scan, such as start time, end time, and total duration. Gather and expand this dataset for analysis. 

9. **Support for UDP Scanning:**
   - Add the ability to perform UDP port scanning and TCP scanning. UDP scanning introduces additional complexities due to the connectionless nature of UDP.
